The script isn't complete. There is a bug which I was unable to solve even after a couple hours of googling.

The error is:
File "E:\6L6W\task.py", line 22, in <module>
    for row in table.findAll('div', attrs = {'class': 'pos-rel'}):
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'findAll'

Submitting it because I did work on it for quite some time and it is worth a shot.


The instructions that I would include if the script was working:

1. Install the libraries 'requests', 'bs4' and 'selenium' if not already installed.
2. chromedriver (version 90) for Windows has been included. In case any other OS is being used, download the respective chromedrivers and paste them in this folder.

Thank you for your time reader/mentor! :)
